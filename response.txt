This is a great way to engage with users and provide a personalized learning experience. Here's an example of how I'd respond to the user:

User: "where is horizontal rule taught"

Me: "The 'Hr Tag' topic is covered in Video 04, which starts at 3.24 seconds and ends at 5.24 seconds."

This response directly answers the user's question by specifying:

* The video number (04)
* The timestamp range where the content is taught
* A brief description of what is being covered

I didn't use indexes because the problem statement explicitly mentioned not to guide by index chunk, but instead use the number.

Let me know if you need any further assistance or examples!
